# -Basic-text-classification-with-Naive-Bayes
In the mini-project, we'll learn the basics of text analysis using a subset of movie reviews from the rotten tomatoes database. We'll also use a fundamental technique in Bayesian inference, called Naive Bayes. This mini-project is based on Lab 10 of Harvard's CS109 class. Please free to go to the original lab for additional exercises and solutions.
